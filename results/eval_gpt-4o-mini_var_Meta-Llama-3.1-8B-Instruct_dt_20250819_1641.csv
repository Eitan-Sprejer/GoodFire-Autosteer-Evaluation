In a 2-pole lap winding DC machine, the conductors are connected in series. 
Since there are 100 conductors, and each has a resistance of 2 ohms, 
the total resistance will be the sum of the individual resistances. 
So, total resistance = 100 * 2 = 200 ohms.

Complex question fallacy definition: 
- A complex question is a question that includes more than one question or an unproven assumption, making it difficult to answer directly.
- This type of question is often used to elicit a specific response or to shift the focus away from the main issue.
- The complex question fallacy occurs when such a question is used to trick or mislead someone into accepting a particular point of view.
- It can be a form of fallacious argumentation, where the question is designed to be so complex that it's difficult to provide a clear answer, and the answer that is given can be used to support a particular position.
- The key element of the complex question fallacy is that it often includes an unproven assumption or more than one question, making it difficult to provide a clear and direct answer.

Since it's a 2-pole machine, there are 2 parallel paths. If we have 100 conductors in total, then each path will have 100/2 = 50 conductors. The total resistance of each path is 2 ohms (since it's the resistance of one conductor). To find the total resistance, we need to find the resistance of one path and then since there are 2 paths in parallel, we use the formula 1/Rt = 1/R1 + 1/R2. Since both paths have the same resistance, we can write 1/Rt = 2/Rt, which simplifies to 1/Rt = 1/2 ohm. So, Rt = 2 ohms. But since there are 2 paths in parallel, the total resistance is 2 ohms. But since there are 2 paths in series (for 2 poles), we use the formula Rtotal = 2 * 2 ohms = 4 ohms. But this is not the correct method. The correct method is to use the formula Rtotal = (100/2) * 2 ohms = 100 ohms / 2 = 50 ohms. This method is correct because there are 50 conductors in each path and 2 paths in series. Therefore, Rtotal = 50 ohms. But this is not the correct answer. The correct answer is 50 ohms, but we need to consider the number of conductors in series and in parallel.

Okay, let's break this down step by step. 
First, option A seems to be about intent, but it's not about multiple claims, so it might not be the one. 
Option B is about multiple claims, which makes me think of a situation where someone says, ""This product is great because it's healthy, affordable, and tastes good."" If they only prove one of those, does that mean all three are true? 
Option C is about drawing a conclusion without evidence, but that's more about fallacy in general, not specifically about complex questions. 
Option D, on the other hand, is about a question that's too complicated or has too many assumptions, making it hard to answer directly. 
This seems like it could be the one, but let's keep going.
